LDAP(open, vendor-neutral) stands for lightweight Directory Access Protocol. For example LDAP is like "what HTTP is to apache webserver" to active directories. That is apache
webserver is a server that uses HTTP. Active directories are largely used for authentication and
authorization and contains the authentications of users in a network. So the key to the information
gain for the hackers lies in the active directories.

A common use of LDAP is to provide a central place to store a usernames and passwords.This allows many different 
different applications and services to connect to the LDAP server to validate users.

NOTE

Active Directory is a directory service for use in a Windows Server environment.It is a distributed hierarchial database structure that
shares infrastructure information for locating, securing, managing and organizing computer and network resources including files,
users, groups, peripherals and network devices.

Active directory is microsofts own directory service for use in Windows domain networks.The directory itself is a LDAP database
that contains networked objects.

LDAP is a lightweight protocol for accessing directory services, and runs over TCP/IP or other
connection oriented transfer services.

LDAP VS AD

Active directory is a database based system that provides authentication, directory, policy and other services in a windows 
environment
LDAP is an application protocol for querying and modifying items in directory service providers liks AD which supports a form
of LDAP
LDAP is standard, AD is proprietary
in short AD is a directory services database, and LDAP is one of the protocols you can use to talk to it.

What kind of information can be stored in the LDAP server directory?
-> The LDAP information model is based on entries.
-> An entry is a collection of attributes that has a globally unique Distinguished name(DN).
-> DN is used to refer to the entry unambiguously.
-> Each of the entry's attributes has a type and one or more values.
-> The types are typically  mnemonic strings, like "cn" for common name, or "mail" for email address.
-> The syntax of values depend on the attribute type for ex a cn might contain value suyog dahal, mail
   attribute might contain the value "suyogdahal@cyberdiscuss.com" and a jpegPhoto attribute would
   contain a photograph in the JPEG (binary) format.

How is the information arranged?
-> In LDAP, directory entries are arranged in a hierarchial tree like structure.
