# Information Security 

-> CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
1. Confidentiality: Confidentiality refers to protecting privacy be it people's or companies.
2. Integrity: Process of protecting the data from any unauthorized changes.
3. Availability: Process of making data Available.
-> Example of Availability:
 Suppose we got a company ABC with one client OH. The company's got a site and a hacker named sitegrimer attacks the company's
 server with DOS. Now the site is down and OH is not able to open the site and get the service of the company. So the availabil-
 ity of the data of the company is down since Denial of Service attack decreases the availability of the services to its victim.
 
 Beside the triumvarite(group of three) CIA there are many more security concerns such as authorization
-> Example of Authorization:
 The users of the software must be able to view own profile but not of other users. The manager must be able to watch the of the 
 employees profile. Thus the process of maintaining these hierarchies is known as authorization. Authorization deals with restric-
tions placed on the authenticated users. Once the user is verified as a user, the manager must enforce restrictions on user's actions.
The two classic methods for enforcing such restrictions are so called access control lists(ACL) and capabilities.
